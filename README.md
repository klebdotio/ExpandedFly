# ExpandedFly
Originally a small skript that auto enables fly on join, designed for survival servers

Commands:
/f Toggles Fly (expandedfly.fly)

Credit for parts of the code goto: MrMonkeyPants34 however I have heavily modified it to an extent where I think I can call it my own.

**UPDATE**
I have completly rewrote the skript into a Java Plugin! Only tested on 1.13.2 and as far as I know requires essentials.
